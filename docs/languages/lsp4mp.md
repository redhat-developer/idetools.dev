# LSP4MP

lsp4mp is a [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) that provides IDE features for working with projects that use [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).

It powers [VS Code Tools for MicroProfile](/docs/languages/vscode-microprofile) and
[Intellij Quarkus](/docs/languages/intellij-quarkus),
as well as [Liberty Tools for Intellij](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-intellij).

It provides IDE features for `microprofile-config.properties` files and enhances the existing Java IDE support with MicroProfile-specific features.
