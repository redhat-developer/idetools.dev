Tools for MicroProfile provides IDE features that help write MicroProfile applications.
Specifically, it provides completion, validation, hover documentation and more for `microprofile-config.properties` files.
Also, it enhances [vscode-java](/docs/languages/vscode-java) with completion, validation, and quick fixes for the annotations introduced by MicroProfile.
This extension works with many different MicroProfile implementations, such as Quarkus and OpenLiberty.
